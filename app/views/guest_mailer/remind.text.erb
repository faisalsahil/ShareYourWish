RSVP and Charity Participation Reminder


Dear <%= @guest.full_name %>, <%= @guest.invited_guest_or_children %> invited to <%= @guest.event.format_child_name %>'s special event, and it's coming up soon.

Please take a minute to visit <%= link_to 'our event page at ShareYourWish.com', invite_url(@guest) %> to let us know if you'll be able to attend, and also whether you'd like to support <%= @guest.event.format_child_name %> by giving a gift that will be shared with a charity.

(The link above is your personal invitation, so don't forward this email to anyone else!)

We hope to see you there, but you can still participate (totally optional!) even if you won't be able to attend. We'd really appreciate your response by <%= @guest.event.rsvp_by.strftime("%A %B %e %Y") %>

From,
<%= @guest.event.host_name %>
